# RmlUI Styling

LichtFeld Studio keeps RmlUI structure, styling, theme values, and runtime state in separate layers.

## Ownership

- `.rml` owns document structure, bindings, stable ids, and semantic classes.
- `.rcss` owns static layout and non-theme styling: spacing, flex rules, dimensions, overflow, typography scale, transitions, and intentionally semantic non-palette colors.
- `.theme.rcss` owns palette-dependent styling. Use it for `color`, `image-color`, `background-color`, `border-color`, themed decorators, shadows, and themed radii.
- C++ owns runtime state only: dynamic geometry, visibility, model-driven attributes, live data values, data-driven colors, and RmlUI behavior properties such as drag or navigation.

Do not generate broad selector styles in C++. If a selector can be edited as a resource, it belongs in `.rcss` or `.theme.rcss`.

## Load Order

Every RmlUI document receives shared component styles first:

1. `components.rcss`
2. `components.theme.rcss`
3. linked `text/rcss` files from the document, in document order
4. the document's sibling `.rcss` if it was not already linked
5. the document's sibling `.theme.rcss`

Documents hosted by `RmlPanelHost` also receive `panel_host.theme.rcss` before the sibling theme file. The host file is intentionally small and should stay generic; panel-specific selectors belong beside the panel.

For a panel named `rendering.rml`, keep the files together:

```text
rendering.rml
rendering.rcss
rendering.theme.rcss
```

## Theme Tokens

Theme files are templates. Use `@{...}` tokens instead of hardcoded palette values:

```css
.panel-title {
    color: @{text};
    border-top-color: @{panel.primary_border_soft};
}

.panel-row:hover {
    background-color: @{alpha(primary,0.12)};
}
```

Supported token forms include palette names such as `@{text}`, `@{surface}`, `@{primary}`, `@{warning}`, `@{error}`, numeric values such as `@{num(size.frame_rounding)}`, and color helpers such as `@{alpha(border,0.4)}` or `@{blend(surface,primary,0.18)}`.

## Theme Catalog

Theme families are listed in `src/visualizer/gui/assets/themes/manifest.json`. The v2 manifest contains only the family `file` and its catalog `order`; each referenced file owns the family id, display name, and its `dark` and/or `light` variants.

Variant display names are independent from their semantic mode. A family can therefore expose concise names such as `Night` and `Day` while the application still treats them as `dark` and `light` for system matching.

The View menu describes the current selection in its own label (`Theme · Family · Variant`). In automatic mode it shows `Auto`, while the concrete dark/light preset follows the operating system behind that saved selection.

Python UI code must read `lf.ui.themes()` instead of hardcoding the catalog. Use `lf.ui.get_theme_family()` and `lf.ui.get_theme_mode()` for selection state, and `lf.ui.set_theme_family(family_id, mode)` to select `dark`, `light`, or `auto`. The legacy preset APIs and v1 manifest remain supported for compatibility.

Gradients are converted into shared RmlUI decorator tokens rather than inspected by individual panels. Providing `panel_body`, for example, also enables the enhanced hosted-panel chrome and supplies the viewport-toolbar base; `progress` supplies selected-control accents. The global `viewport_chrome_style` preference chooses solid, translucent, or frosted presentation without adding a manifest field. Viewport chrome blends `panel_body` with the theme's primary and secondary colors so each family remains identifiable. Flat themes remain valid because every consumer has a palette-derived fallback.

Frosted presentation is composited below the cached RmlUi overlay. The Vulkan renderer downsamples the current scene twice, upscales it with linear filtering, and clips the result to visible viewport controls before RmlUi draws tint, borders, icons, and text. This keeps theme chrome cacheable and bounds the per-frame cost. If the swapchain image or format cannot use the required transfer and linear-blit features, the translucent themed layer remains the readability fallback.

See [Theme format v2](./theme-format.md) for the complete file contract, consumer mapping, downloadable template, and fallback behavior.

## Hot Reload

RmlUI hot reload watches `.rml`, `.rcss`, and `.theme.rcss`. Editing a resource should change the live UI without requiring a C++ rebuild.

If a theme edit appears to do nothing, check for one of these issues:

- The selector is still styled in C++ with `SetProperty`.
- The selector is in a shared theme file that loads after the file you edited.
- The element is using a data-driven inline style, such as chart coordinates or timeline positions.
- The file is not the document's sibling `.theme.rcss` and is not imported by that document.

## C++ Rules

Allowed `SetProperty` examples:

- popup `left` / `top`
- viewport or document `width` / `height`
- virtual-list row `top`
- `display` for runtime visibility
- progress width or model-driven chart geometry
- data-driven colors, for example per-keyframe color chips
- explicit user/API sizing, for example an immediate-mode `button(size=...)`
- RmlUI behavior properties such as `drag`, `nav-left`, and `nav-right`

Avoid `SetProperty` for static styling:

- default `position`, `left`, `right`, `width`, `height`
- default text colors
- default backgrounds and borders
- icon colors
- fixed padding, margins, radius, and shadows

The Python immediate-mode bridge follows the same rule. Generated elements should receive semantic classes such as `.im-control--fill` or `.im-label--centered`; only data colors, caller-supplied sizes, tooltip coordinates, and runtime state should remain inline.

When in doubt, create a class in `.rml` or C++, put static layout in `.rcss`, and put palette-dependent values in `.theme.rcss`.

## Viewport overlay geometry

Each 3D editor area owns its camera and header. Viewport controls use the
content rectangle of their area; comparison panels share that area's camera.
